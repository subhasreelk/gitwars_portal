# GitWars Portal - Image Assets

Place the following Star Wars themed images in this folder:

## Required Images

1. **starwars-logo.png** (280x120 approx)
   - Star Wars logo in yellow/gold
   - Used on the public leaderboard page header
   - PNG with transparent background preferred

2. **jedi-character.png** (140x200 approx)
   - Cartoon/chibi style Jedi character
   - Shown on login page (left side)
   - Examples: Young Jedi, Luke, or generic Jedi with lightsaber
   - PNG with transparent background

3. **sith-character.png** (140x200 approx)
   - Cartoon/chibi style Sith character
   - Shown on login page (right side)
   - Examples: Dark robed figure with red lightsaber
   - PNG with transparent background

4. **droid-character.png** (100x120 approx)
   - Cartoon/chibi style droid character
   - Shown on admin page (bottom right corner)
   - Examples: R2-D2, C-3PO, or Yoda
   - PNG with transparent background

## Optional Additional Assets

5. **space-bg.mp4** (if you want video background instead of CSS stars)
   - Looping starfield video
   - Dark space with subtle star movement

## Notes

- All images should have transparent backgrounds (PNG format)
- Chibi/cartoon style matches the playful theme
- Characters should face inward (toward the content)
- Keep file sizes optimized for web (under 200KB each)

## Fallback Behavior

If images are missing, the portal will still work - characters simply won't appear.
The animated starfield background is CSS-based and doesn't require any image files.
